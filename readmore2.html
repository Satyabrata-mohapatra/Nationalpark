    <h1>Important Guidelines for Similipal National Park</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>1. Obey Entry and Exit Timings</h2>
    <p>Visitors are allowed to enter the park only between sunrise and sunset. The exact timings may vary depending on the season, so check with the park authorities before planning your visit.</p>
    <p><strong>Entry Time:</strong> Ensure you arrive early as entry is permitted only during daylight hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Exit Time:</strong> Visitors must exit the park before dark for safety reasons. No entry is allowed after sunset.</p>

    <h2>2. Obtain a Valid Entry Permit</h2>
    <p>All visitors, including tourists and researchers, must obtain an <span class="highlight">entry permit</span> from the forest department or authorized ticket counters before entering the park. The permit is typically issued for a specified number of days and for a particular route or zone within the park.</p>

    <h2>3. Guided Tours</h2>
    <p>It is highly recommended to visit the park with a <span class="highlight">licensed guide</span>. Guides are well-trained in identifying wildlife, understanding the terrain, and ensuring that visitors follow proper behavior while in the park. They will help in spotting animals safely and ensure you do not disrupt the natural environment.</p>

    <h2>4. Respect Wildlife and Habitat</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not disturb, feed, or harass animals. Avoid using flash photography as it may stress the wildlife.</li>
        <li>Maintain a safe distance from animals, particularly predators such as tigers and leopards.</li>
        <li>Avoid making loud noises that could disturb the wildlife or the peaceful ambiance of the park.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Strict No-Entry Zones</h2>
    <p>Some areas within the park may be off-limits to tourists for conservation reasons. Do not enter <span class="highlight">restricted zones</span> and follow all posted signs and instructions from park authorities.</p>

    <h2>6. Leave No Trace</h2>
    <p>Carry out all waste (plastic, food wrappers, etc.) with you when you leave. Dispose of waste responsibly at designated areas outside the park. Avoid leaving behind any litter or non-biodegradable materials. Do not pick plants, flowers, or collect wildlife souvenirs.</p>

    <h2>7. No Smoking, Alcohol, or Firearms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Smoking</span> and consumption of alcohol is prohibited inside the park to protect the environment and wildlife.</li>
        <li>Firearms and weapons are not permitted within the park, and possession of such items is illegal and punishable under forest protection laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Respect Indigenous Tribes and Communities</h2>
    <p>Similipal is home to several indigenous tribes, including the <span class="highlight">Santhal</span>, <span class="highlight">Munda</span>, and <span class="highlight">Ho</span> tribes. Always be respectful of their customs, traditions, and practices. Do not engage in any form of commercial activity with these communities without proper permissions from authorities. Do not photograph individuals or tribal communities without their consent.</p>

    <h2>9. Stay on Designated Paths</h2>
    <p>Always stick to designated trails and paths during your visit. Venturing off the marked routes can damage the environment and put visitors at risk. Avoid disturbing the forest floor or altering the landscape in any way.</p>

    <h2>10. Maintain Silence and Minimize Noise</h2>
    <p>Keep noise levels to a minimum. Loud sounds can disturb wildlife and may cause them to flee from their natural habitats. Respect the tranquility of nature and encourage others to do the same.</p>

    <h2>11. Follow Wildlife Viewing Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not exit vehicles or venture too close to animals during safaris or hikes.</li>
        <li>Only park vehicles in designated areas, and never block animal movement or roads.</li>
        <li>Use binoculars or long lenses for wildlife observation, rather than getting too close to animals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Avoid Using Plastic and Non-Biodegradable Items</h2>
    <p>Plastic bags, bottles, and non-biodegradable items are a serious environmental hazard. Avoid using them inside the park. Carry reusable alternatives like cloth bags or bottles to minimize waste.</p>

    <h2>13. Report Suspicious Activities</h2>
    <p>If you observe illegal activities such as poaching, illegal logging, or any other suspicious behavior, report it immediately to park authorities or forest rangers. Your vigilance can help preserve the park's ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>14. Conserve Water and Energy</h2>
    <p>Do not waste water inside the park, as it is a valuable resource. Use water efficiently, especially in remote areas. Be conscious of your energy usage, particularly in eco-friendly lodges or campsites.</p>

    <h2>15. Respect the Rules of Eco-Tourism</h2>
    <p>Similipal has become a popular eco-tourism destination, and it is important to respect the principles of responsible tourism. Support sustainable lodging options, engage in eco-friendly activities, and contribute positively to local communities.</p>

    <h2>16. No Night Stays Without Permission</h2>
    <p>Overnight stays inside the park are generally restricted unless prior permission has been obtained. Unauthorized stays can lead to fines or penalties. Ensure you are staying at authorized eco-lodges or camps in designated zones.</p>

    <h2>17. Check Weather Conditions</h2>
    <p>Similipal's weather can vary, so check the forecast before your visit. Prepare for sudden changes, especially during the monsoon season. Carry appropriate gear such as raincoats, comfortable footwear, and insect repellent.</p>
