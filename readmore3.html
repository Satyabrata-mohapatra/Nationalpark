    <p><span class="status">Conservation Status:</span> Endangered (IUCN Red List)</p>
    <p>The Bengal tiger is one of the most iconic animals of Similipal. As a part of Indiaâ€™s Project Tiger initiative, Similipal plays an essential role in tiger conservation. The tiger population here is considered stable, and the forest provides a critical habitat for these majestic predators. Bengal tigers are apex predators, primarily feeding on large herbivores like deer and wild boar.</p>

    <h2>2. Indian Elephant (<span class="animal-name">Elephas maximus indicus</span>)</h2>
    <p><span class="status">Conservation Status:</span> Endangered (IUCN Red List)</p>
    <p>The Indian elephant is a subspecies of the Asian elephant and is found in the dense forests of Similipal. Elephants are important for maintaining ecological balance by dispersing seeds and creating clearings in the forest. The elephants in Similipal are often found in the southern parts of the reserve, where they roam in herds.</p>

    <h2>3. Leopard (<span class="animal-name">Panthera pardus</span>)</h2>
    <p><span class="status">Conservation Status:</span> Vulnerable (IUCN Red List)</p>
    <p>Leopards are solitary, nocturnal predators that inhabit various types of landscapes, from forests to grasslands. In Similipal, they are an important part of the ecosystem, preying on smaller animals like deer, monkeys, and wild boar. Leopards are highly adaptable, and their elusive nature makes them difficult to spot in the wild.</p>

    <h2>4. Wild Boar (<span class="animal-name">Sus scrofa</span>)</h2>
    <p><span class="status">Conservation Status:</span> Least Concern (IUCN Red List)</p>
    <p>The wild boar is a common mammal in Similipal and an important prey species for predators like tigers and leopards. These omnivores are found in various habitats, including the forest and grasslands, where they feed on roots, fruits, and small animals. Wild boars play a crucial role in seed dispersal and soil turnover.</p>

    <h2>5. Sambar Deer (<span class="animal-name">Rusa unicolor</span>)</h2>
    <p><span class="status">Conservation Status:</span> Least Concern (IUCN Red List)</p>
    <p>The sambar deer is one of the most abundant herbivores in Similipal. These large deer are primarily nocturnal and are commonly found in the forested areas.

    <p>The Indian wolf is a rare and elusive predator found in the dry forests and grasslands of Similipal. These wolves primarily hunt in packs and feed on small to medium-sized mammals like deer, hares, and wild boar. Wolves are crucial for regulating the populations of herbivores in the region.</p>

    <h2>8. Jungle Cat (<span class="animal-name">Felis chaus</span>)</h2>
    <p><span class="status">Conservation Status:</span> Least Concern (IUCN Red List)</p>
    <p>The jungle cat is a small wild cat species found in the forests and grasslands of Similipal. They are solitary and nocturnal, primarily hunting small mammals like rodents, birds, and reptiles. Jungle cats are highly adaptable and are often found near human settlements, though they prefer undisturbed habitats.</p>

    <h2>9. Nilgai (<span class="animal-name">Boselaphus tragocamelus</span>)</h2>
    <p><span class="status">Conservation Status:</span> Least Concern (IUCN Red List)</p>
